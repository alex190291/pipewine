# PipeWire ASIO Driver Performance Optimizations

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive performance optimizations implemented in the PipeWire ASIO driver to achieve professional-grade low-latency audio performance. These optimizations target real-time audio processing, memory management, threading, and compiler optimizations.

## 1. Real-Time Audio Processing Optimizations

### 1.1 Optimized Process Callback (`pipewire_process_callback`)

**Key Improvements:**
- **Branch Prediction Hints**: Added `likely()` and `unlikely()` macros to optimize CPU branch prediction
- **Eliminated Debug Logging**: Removed all debug printf statements from the real-time audio path
- **Optimized Memory Operations**: Replaced `memcpy`/`memset` with `__builtin_memcpy`/`__builtin_memset` for compiler optimization hints
- **Pre-calculated Values**: Moved repeated calculations outside loops to reduce CPU overhead
- **Fast Path Optimization**: Optimized the common case where buffer sizes match

**Before:**
```c
static int callback_count = 0;
if (callback_count < 10) {
    printf("Process callback #%d: pw_samples=%zu, asio_samples=%zu\n", ...);
    callback_count++;
}
```

**After:**
```c
/* Fast validation - minimize branches in real-time path */
if (unlikely(!This || This->asio_driver_state != Running || !This->asio_callbacks)) {
    /* Optimized silence output */
    return;
}
```

### 1.2 Eliminated Blocking System Calls

**Problem**: The original code used `system()` calls and `usleep()` in the audio processing path, causing unpredictable latency spikes.

**Solution**: Replaced system calls with direct PipeWire API calls:

**Before:**
```c
char quantum_cmd[256];
snprintf(quantum_cmd, sizeof(quantum_cmd), "pw-metadata -n settings 0 clock.quantum %d", buffer_size);
int result = system(quantum_cmd);
usleep(100000); /* 100ms blocking delay */
```

**After:**
```c
struct pw_metadata *metadata = pw_core_get_metadata(This->pw_core, "settings");
if (metadata) {
    char quantum_str[32];
    snprintf(quantum_str, sizeof(quantum_str), "%d", This->asio_current_buffersize);
    pw_metadata_set_property(metadata, 0, "clock.quantum", "Int32", quantum_str);
}
```

## 2. Memory Management Optimizations

### 2.1 Cache-Aligned Buffer Allocation

**Optimization**: Aligned all audio buffers to cache line boundaries (64 bytes) for optimal CPU cache performance.

```c
#define CACHE_LINE_SIZE 64
#define ALIGN_TO_CACHE_LINE(size) (((size) + CACHE_LINE_SIZE - 1) & ~(CACHE_LINE_SIZE - 1))

/* Align to cache line boundaries and ensure power-of-2 alignment for SIMD */
size_t aligned_size = ALIGN_TO_CACHE_LINE(chan->buffer_size);
chan->wine_buffers[0] = HeapAlloc(GetProcessHeap(), HEAP_ZERO_MEMORY, aligned_size);
```

### 2.2 Optimized Memory Copy Operations

**Improvements:**
- Used compiler intrinsics (`__builtin_memcpy`, `__builtin_memset`) for better optimization
- Pre-calculated buffer sizes to avoid repeated calculations
- Optimized zero-padding operations for buffer size mismatches

## 3. Threading and Synchronization Optimizations

### 3.1 CPU Affinity Optimization

**Added**: Thread affinity setting to prevent CPU migration and improve cache locality:

```c
/* Set thread affinity to avoid CPU migration for better cache performance */
DWORD_PTR process_affinity, system_affinity;
if (GetProcessAffinityMask(GetCurrentProcess(), &process_affinity, &system_affinity)) {
    /* Pin to first available CPU core for consistent performance */
    DWORD_PTR thread_affinity = process_affinity & (-(LONG_PTR)process_affinity);
    SetThreadAffinityMask(g_callback_manager.callback_thread, thread_affinity);
}
```

### 3.2 Optimized ASIO Callback Marshalling

**Improvements:**
- Reduced callback timeout from 1000ms to 100ms for faster failure detection
- Minimized critical section usage in real-time path
- Optimized callback data preparation

## 4. Compiler Optimizations

```

### 4.2 Branch Prediction Optimization

Added compiler hints for better branch prediction:

```c
#define likely(x)       __builtin_expect(!!(x), 1)
#define unlikely(x)     __builtin_expect(!!(x), 0)

/* Usage in hot paths */
if (likely(pw_sample_count == asio_sample_count)) {
    /* Fast path: direct copy */
    __builtin_memcpy(pw_buffer, chan->wine_buffers[current_buffer_index], asio_buffer_bytes);
} else {
    /* Slower path: handle size mismatch */
    // ...
}
```
